    <p>3-Domain Secure (3D Secure or 3DS) authentication provides an extra level of security with online purchases by requiring customers to complete an addititional verification step.  This authentication is based on a three-domain model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Acquirer domain - the bank and merchant to which the money is being paid</li>
      <li>Issuer domain - the card issuer</li>
      <li>Interoperability Domain - the infrastructure provided by the payment card to support the 3D Secure protocol</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3D Secure incorporates a one-time passcode sent as part of an SMS text message to the user's mobile phone or email for authentication.</p>

    <h3>Platform</h3>
    <p>Beacon viewers will be able to purchase content through Stripe using cards that support 3D secure protection on the following platform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Process flow</h3>
    <p>Customers who initiate the payment process on the web with a 3DS-supported card will use the 3DS payment flow via Stripe.</p>
    <p>The following steps occur outside of the Beacon app:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Viewers are directed to a 3DS page and asked to verify that they are the rightful card owner by supplying a password or PIN</li>
      <li>The PIN is a one-time value that they receive via phone or SMS</li>
      <li>
        <p>If the PIN is entered correctly within a defined time, the viewer can complete their purchase successfully</p>
        <p>If the viewer doesn't enter the correct PIN in the time provided, they will not be able to complete their purchase</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the viewer successfully completes the purchase through the 3DS flow, then the Beacon app will let the viewer know that their purchase is complete.</p>
    <p>If the viewer doesn't successfully complete the 3DS flow, the Beacon app will display an error message.</p>

    <p>You can use the Beacon Studio to associate TVOD plans with media content.</p>
